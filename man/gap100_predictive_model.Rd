\title{Predictive model for annual and perennial canopy gaps > 100 cm}
\format{
A linear model that predicts CA_percent_100plus (\% cover of annual and perennial canopy gaps > 100 cm)
\describe{
\item{CP_percent_100plus}{Independent variable representing \% cover of perennial canopy gaps > 100 cm}
\item{AH_AnnForbGrassCover}{Independent variable representing any-hit \% cover of annual herbaceous plants from LPI}
}

}
\description{
This model can estimate percent cover of annual and perennial canopy gaps >
100 cm using percent cover of perennial canopy gaps > 100 cm and any-hit
annual herbaceous cover. It was built using data from all NRI and LMF plots
in the Upper Colorado River Basin where both perennial gaps and annual +
perennial gaps were measure at the same time.Cases where annual and
perennial gap cover was greater than 1 standard deviation above perennial gap
cover were excluded because annual and perennial gap cover typically should
not exceed perennial gap cover, but occasionally does does due to measurement
errors. Adjusted R-squared: 0.831; P-value < 0.001
