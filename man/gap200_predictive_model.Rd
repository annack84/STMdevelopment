\title{Predictive model for annual and perennial canopy gaps > 200 cm}
\format{
A linear model that predicts CA_percent_200plus (\% cover of annual and perennial canopy gaps > 200 cm)
\describe{
\item{CP_percent_200plus}{Independent variable representing \% cover of perennial canopy gaps > 200 cm}
\item{AH_AnnForbGrassCover}{Independent variable representing any-hit \% cover of annual herbaceous plants from LPI}
}

}
\description{
This model can estimate percent cover of annual and perennial canopy gaps >
200 cm using percent cover of perennial canopy gaps > 200 cm and any-hit
annual herbaceous cover. It was built using data from all NRI and LMF plots
in the Upper Colorado River Basin where both perennial gaps and annual +
perennial gaps were measure at the same time. Adjusted R-squared:  0.8462
